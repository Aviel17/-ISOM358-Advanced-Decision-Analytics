## [ISOM358] Advanced Decision Analytics - Final Project

# Context
Volunteer Medical Interpretation Services (VMIS) is an Emory organization training Spanish and Portuguese-speaking students to provide interpreting services for clinics in Atlanta, bridging the linguistic barrier between patients and physicians.

Given 30 volunteers, 40 operating hours per week, and 1-hour time slots, we strived to address two central paint points:
  1. Time-consuming process to satisfy everyone's availability
  2. Creating a new schedule every semester

# Goal
Alleviate such pain points with a user-friendly Excel Add-In tool that automatically creates and optimizes the on-call schedule based on studentsâ€™ preferences.
